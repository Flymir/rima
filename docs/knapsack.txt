# Rima: The Knapsack Problem

[ [Contents](contents.html) ]

This is a Rima version of the "burglar bill"
[XPress knapsack example](http://dashoptimization.com/home/cgi-bin/example.pl?id=mosel_model_2_2).
A knapsack problem involves picking items to fill a knapsack of limited
capacity with items of maximum value.
We have a list of items, each with a weight and capacity, and wish to choose
which we'll take.

We start by requiring the Rima module:

    rima = require("rima")

Then we define some variables, or *references* with `rima.R`.
Note that at this stage we don't have to tell Rima anything about the
types of our variables, or whether they're parameters or variables we
wish to solve for.
We define references to our list of items, a reference to use for a single item
and the total capacity of the knapsack:

    --! continue
    items, item = rima.R"items, item"
    capacity = rima.R"capacity"

Next, we define our two equations, one for the value of the items we're
putting in the knapsack, and one for the weight of the items.
Note that we're using syntax like `item.picked`, `item.value` and `item.weight` -
Rima understands data structures like a dynamic language should.
Also, we haven't defined these fields or structures at all,
when Rima has the data, it'll check it works as expected - duck typing for a
modelling language!

    --! continue
    value = rima.sum{item=items}(item.picked * item.value)
    weight = rima.sum{item=items}(item.picked * item.weight)

We create a new formulation, set its objective:

    --! continue
    knapsack = rima.new()
    knapsack.objective = value
    knapsack.sense = "maximise"

A formulation is just a scope,
and the objective and optimisation sense are just variables in the scope.
Rima accepts both `"maximise"` and `"maximize"`.

We use `rima.mp.C` to construct a constraint,
and add it to the scope like any other value::

    --! continue
    knapsack.weight_limit = rima.mp.C(weight, "<=", capacity)

Finally, we define `item.picked` as a binary variable:

    --! continue
    knapsack.items[item].picked = rima.binary()

And we're done.  `knapsack` is a complete definition of a knapsack problem.
You can derive from it, compose a new model with it, make a Lua module out
of it and we can even write it out in a readable format:

    --! continue
    rima.mp.write(knapsack)
    --> Maximise:
    -->   sum{item in items}(item.picked*item.value)
    --> Subject to:
    -->   weight_limit: sum{item in items}(item.picked*item.weight) <= capacity

So far, we've seen no data, other than the one bit we wanted -
defining as `items[item].picked` as a binary variable.
Of course, we can't solve anything without data.

Data's easy to add: we create an `instance` of the problem and pass it a
table of data:

    --! continue
    burglar_bill = rima.instance(knapsack, \
    { \
      capacity = 102, \
      items = \
      { \
        camera   = { value =  15, weight =  2 }, \
        necklace = { value = 100, weight = 20 }, \
        vase     = { value =  15, weight = 20 }, \
        picture  = { value =  15, weight = 30 }, \
        tv       = { value =  15, weight = 40 }, \
        video    = { value =  15, weight = 30 }, \
        chest    = { value =  15, weight = 60 }, \
        brick    = { value =   1, weight = 10 }, \
      } \
    })

`burglar_bill` is also a formulation: if we'd only given it partial data,
we could create a new instance for further specialisation.
Just like `knapsack`, it can write itself (but we'll save you the output for now).

To solve the problem, just choose a solver, and use the `solve` method:

    --! continue
    objective, r = rima.mp.solve("cbc", burglar_bill)

We can check the objective:

    --! continue
    print(objective)                                    --> 160

And see if it was worth taking the brick or necklace in the knapsack:

    --! continue
    print(r.items.brick.picked.p)                       --> 0
    print(r.items.necklace.picked.p)                    --> 1

Notice that our results follow the same structure as the input data,
and that we access the primal value of the solution with `p`
(and the dual with `d`).
