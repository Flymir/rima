# Rima Manual: References

[ [Contents](contents.html) | Previous: [Introduction to Lua](trouble.html) | Next: [Expressions](expressions.html) ]

The values Rima works with, called *references*, are quite different from Lua variables,
and probably quite different from variables and parameters you've seen in other modelling languages.

For a start, Rima doesn't distinguish between variables
(values Rima should solve for)
and parameters
(values that are inputs to the problem).
Instead, when you ask Rima to solve a problem,
it works out what it does and doesn't know,
and if it can work out what it doesn't from what it does.

Secondly, you can't directly assign a value to a reference.
Instead, references are just the names you'll use to refer to your values,
and the names you'll use to bind to data later.


## Defining References

You define a reference with `rima.R`:

    x = rima.R"x"
    print(x)                                            --> x

`x` is now a Lua variable (so we can use it in Lua) that points to a Rima
reference called `x`.
You don't *have* to use the same name for the Lua variable and the reference,
but if you don't you might get horribly confused:

    x = rima.R"y"
    print(x)                                            --> y

If you wish to define more than one variable at a time, you can:

    x, y = rima.R"x, y"

If you're using variables in the global scope
(we were above, and do for most of the manual),
then `rima.define` offers an even easier way to define references.
It automatically inserts the new references into the global scope:

    rima.define("x, y")
    print(x + y)                                        --> x + y

If, on they other hand, your references are going into a local scope,
you must use `rima.R` - there's no way of inserting variables into a local scope.

In the rest of the manual, we'll use `rima.R` and `rima.define` from time to time,
the effect is the same,
and you can choose which suits you.


## Evaluating References

You can *evaluate* a reference with `rima.E`.
We pass `rima.E` the reference we wish to evaluate,
and a table of values to look the reference up in:

    x = rima.R"x"
    print(rima.E(x, { x=5 }))                           --> 5

You can use the same reference in more than one evaluation,
with different tables:

    rima.define"x"
    print(rima.E(x, { x=5 }))                           --> 5
    print(rima.E(x, { x="hello" }))                     --> hello

Again, it's a good idea to give your variables and references the same name:

    x = rima.R"y"
    print(rima.E(x, { x="I'm x", y="I'm y" }))         --> I'm y

If you're a Lua user, it might help to think of rima.E as something like `setfenv`
and references as global variables.
If you're used to object oriented languages,
it might help to thing of references as pointers to members,
and the tables you pass in as objects.


## References to References

It's quite ok for the table of values you pass in to contain other references:

    rima.define"x, y, z"
    print(rima.E(x, { x=y, y=z, z="you got to z!" }))   --> you got to z!

Next, we cover `rima.E` in more detail when building expressions.
